This is my very repository with the Kekambas 142 cohort. 

### Git Commands
- `git init` to create a new repository
- `git add <filename>` or `git add .` to add files to staged changes
- `git commit -m "Your Message Here"` to commit (or take snapshot) 
- `git remote add <remote_name> <remote_URL>` to add remote connection to GitHub 
    - `<remote_name>` will usually be `origin`
    - `<remote_url>` is the URL to GitHub Repository
`git push <remote_name> <branch_name>` to send commits to Github
    -`<remote_name>` will usually be `origin`
    -`<branch_name>` will usually be `main`
    You can add `-u` flag to command to set up tracking
